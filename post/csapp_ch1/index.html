<h3 id="ascii">ASCII</h3>
<p>ASCII, abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard, which is mainly focused on English characters. This encoding method cannot represent some special characters, such as the Chinese character &ldquo;‰πê&rdquo;, and the thinking face emotion &ldquo;ü§î&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At present, ASCII includes 128 characters, which are encoded from 0x00 to 0x7F.  If a C source file does not contain any special characters mentioned above, the content is as same as the ASCII, because many subsequent character encoding methods are compatible with ASCII. Take <code>hello.c</code> for example.</p>

<p>Actually, Linux normally do not use ASCII as its character encoding method, and you can use the command locale to check this.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>We can find that the character encoding method of my system is UTF-8. But before we enter into UTF-8, let us go through what Unicode is first. Unicode, formally The Unicode Standard, is a standard that includes almost all characters around the world, such as Chinese, Japanese and Arabic characters. The range of this standard is from 0x00 to 0x10FFFF and covers more than one million different characters. Obviously, this representation needs one byte, two bytes or three bytes to store a certain character. If all characters are represented by three bytes, then for those characters that can be represented by one byte, the other two bytes are meaningless, which is a huge waste for storage. For example, all English characters can be represented by one byte like ASCII, we do not hope to use three bytes to store them. To satisfy various requirements, therefore, there are various storage methods for Unicode, the common ones are UTF-8, UTF-16, as well as UTF-32, and they use different binary formats to represent Unicode characters respectively.</p>
<h4 id="utf-8">UTF-8</h4>
<p>UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding standard, defined as the encoding of a certain character into one to four bytes.</p>
<p>The encoding rule of UTF-8:</p>
<ol>
<li>For one byte encoding, the <em>most significant bit(MSB)</em> is always zero, and resting seven bits cover whole characters of ASCII.</li>
<li>For encoding more than one byte, such as n bytes, the first n bits of n bytes is one and  the (n+1)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is zero. And for subsequent bytes, the first 2 bits are all set as one and zero, respectively.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now let us try to convert a Unicode representation to the binary form. Take emoji &ldquo;ü§î&rdquo; for example, and it is represented as U+1F914 in Unicode.</p>
<p>$$1F914_{16} = (000\ 011111\ 100100\ 010100)_2$$</p>
<p>Therefore, the result is $(\underline{11110}000\ \underline{10}011111\ \underline{10}100100\ \underline{10}010100)_2$. In the UTF-8 standard, &ldquo;ü§î&rdquo; is stored by four bytes.</p>
<p>If you store this emoji in a file named x and use the command <code>hexdump</code>, you can get:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">$&gt;hexdump -C x

<h4 id="utf-16">UTF-16</h4>
<p>UTF-16 is also a variable-width character encoding standard, defined as the encoding of a certain character into two or four bytes.</p>
<p>The encoding rule of UTF-16:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For characters with Unicode code less than 0x10000, two bytes are used to store each of them, and there is no need to add other bits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For characters with Unicode code between 0x10000 and 0x10FFFF, two bytes are used to store them, which are divided into two parts. There is an additional operation to subtract 0x10000 from the original Unicode value. For the first bytes, the first six bits are 110110, and for the fourth byte, the first six bits are 110111.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</table>
<p>For English character &lsquo;A&rsquo; (less than 0x10000), apparently its UTF-16 code is $(00000000\ 01000001)_2$, i.e. 0x0041.</p>
<p>For emoji &ldquo;ü§î&rdquo; ($1F914_{16} &gt; 10000_{16}$, more than 0x10000), $1F914_{16} - 10000_{16} = F914_{16}$. Its UTF-16 code is $(\underline{110110}00\ 00111110\ \underline{110111}01\ 00010100)_2$, i.e. 0xD83EDD14.</p>
<h4 id="utf-32">UTF-32</h4>
<p>UTF-32 is a fixed-length encoding that always occupies four bytes, enough to accommodate all Unicode characters, so it can be stored directly in Unicode codes without any encoding conversion. Although it wastes storage, it improves efficiency.</p>
<p>For &lsquo;A&rsquo;, it will be stored as 0x00000041, and for &lsquo;ü§î&rsquo;, it will be stored as 0x0001F914.</p>
<h3 id="gbk-big5-etc">GBK, Big5, etc.</h3>
<p>They are historical legacies. Before Unicode, there were different encodings for encoding characters in computers all over the world, especially in East Asia, such as GB2312 in mainland China, which was later expanded to GBK, Big5 in Taiwan, and SHIFT-JIS in Japan. It is compatible with ASCII, and it maintains the code of the original string program (all char arrays), and it is self-synchronizing, so it quickly became popular and became the choice of string encoding for those who want to be cross-platform and support multiple languages.</p>
<h2 id="compilation-system">Compilation System</h2>
<p>We will use <code>main.c</code> as an example to explore the process of compilation.</p>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="preprocess">Preprocess</h3>
<p>Preprocess mainly modifies the original program according to directives that begin with &ldquo;#&rdquo;, such as <code>#define</code> and <code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>. We use the command <code>cpp</code> to preprocess this file and get this:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>There are some new output at the top of the file, which is much like a &ldquo;debugging&rdquo; or &ldquo;logging&rdquo;, (or even &ldquo;storytelling&rdquo;) session of what the preprocessor is doing and how. It will basically tell you through on how it is expanding the macros found. Source file name and line number information is conveyed by lines of the form:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>They are called linemarkers, inserted as needed into the output (but never within a string or character constant). This means that the following line (<code>...</code>, a certain linemarker) originated at line number <code>linenum</code> in file <code>filename</code>. The optional <code>flags</code> are:</p>

<p><code>&lt;built-in&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;command-line&gt; </code>  are not real files. They are non-file sources of preprocessor tokens that need to be represented somehow in the output format, so they are treated as if they were files. Call them pseudo-files.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;built-in&gt;</code> is the pseudo-file that contains the compiler&rsquo;s built-in macro definitions, like <code>__LINE__</code>, <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__DATE__</code>.</li>
<li><code>&lt;command-line&gt;</code> is from the preprocessor (usually GCC) command line, considered as a source of macro definitions (and possibly un-definitions), such as the command <code>gcc ... -DFOO=1 -UBAR ...</code> and so on.</li>

<p>Actually, these output directives are not dispensable for compiling. Their purposes are:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the compiler encounters an error, it uses the most recent line number directive to determine what file and line to reference in the error message. (The <code>#line</code> directive can even be used in generated code to allow error messages to point directly to the original source file, rather than to an intermediate C source file.)</li>
<li>If debugging information (<code>-g</code>) is turned on, line number data is included in debug sections of the generated object file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Neither of these purposes is critical, so you would be free to delete these directives before compiling. The really &ldquo;useful&rdquo; part is as    follow:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-C" data-lang="C"><span style="color:#2b91af">int</span> main(<span style="color:#2b91af">void</span>) {

<h3 id="concepts-users-view">Concepts (users' view)</h3>
<h4 id="process">Process</h4>
<p>A process is an instance of a program in execution. It is an independent unit of the system for resource allocation and scheduling, focusing on system scheduling and individual units, i.e. a process is a section of a program that can run independently.</p>
<h4 id="thread">Thread</h4>
<p>A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization; it comprise a thread id, a program counter, a register set and a stack. It shares with other threads belonging to the same process its code section, data section and other operating-system resources, such as open files and signals. Thread is also called <em>light-weight process (LWP)</em>. A traditional process has a single thread of control. If a process has multiple threads of control, it can perform more than one task at a time.</p>
<h4 id="differences">Differences</h4>
<p>In a process there may be many threads, and their differences are as follow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One way of looking at a process is that it is a way to group related resources together. A process has an address space containing program text and data, as well as other resources. These resource may include open files, child processes, pending alarms, signal handlers, accounting information, and more. By putting them together in the form of a process, they can be managed more easily. The other concept a process has is a thread of execution, usually shortened to just thread. The thread has a program counter that keeps track of which instruc¬≠tion to execute next. It has registers, which hold its current working variables. It has a stack, which contains the execution history, with one frame for each proce¬≠dure called but not yet returned from. Although a thread must execute in some process, the thread and its process are different concepts and can be treated sepa¬≠rately. Processes are used to group resources together; threads are the entities scheduled for execution on the CPU.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-in-linux-kernals-view">Implementation in Linux (kernal&rsquo;s view)</h3>
<p>The concepts mentioned above may be extremely confusing. Let us go through their implementation in Linux briefly.</p>
<p>Actually, it is boring and meaningless to distinguish them. In Linux, everything is simply a runnable task. There is a C structure named <code>task_struct</code>, to describe the so-called process and thread. There are two key values in this structure ‚Äî‚Äî <code>pid </code>(process ID) and <code>tgid</code> (task group ID), and we denote them as <em>struct_pid</em> and <em>struct_tgid</em> for ease of description, respectively. In Linux, each process has a distinct <em>struct_tgid</em> value and each thread has a distinct <em>struct_pid</em> value, so to some extent in Linux there is no special implementation for threads. Threads are treated as single-threaded processes (or namely tasks) while processes are treated as groups of single-threaded processes (or namely task groups). More briefly, threads are tasks and processes are groups of tasks. More interestingly, when you call the function <code>getpid()</code>, it returns <em>struct_tgid</em> rather than <em>struct_pid</em>. The following illustration may be helpful for understanding this:</p>

<p>There was an email <a href="https://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9608/0191.html">Re: proc fs and shared pids</a> from Linus that may be an excellent interpretation about differences between thread and process in Linux.</p>
<h2 id="concurrency-and-parallelism">Concurrency and Parallelism</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, concurrency is generally mentioned more in the context of programming while parallelism is mentioned more in the context of hardware. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once. The following figure may help you understand it.</p>
